# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Assignment üêçüèóÔ∏è

This project demonstrates fundamental **OOP principles in Python**, including classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. The assignment is divided into two main activities: designing your own class and exploring polymorphism.

## **Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class ‚Äì Smartphone Example** üì±

**Description:**  
- Create a `Smartphone` class with attributes like brand, model, and price.  
- Include methods to display details and perform actions like making calls.  
- Extend the class with an `AdvancedSmartphone` subclass, adding attributes like camera megapixels and battery capacity.  
- Demonstrate **inheritance** and **polymorphism** by overriding methods in the subclass.

**Example Usage:**
```python
phone1 = Smartphone("Nokia", "3310", 50)
phone2 = AdvancedSmartphone("Apple", "iPhone 15", 1200, 48, 4000)

phone1.show_details()
phone1.make_call("0712345678")

phone2.show_details()
phone2.make_call("0798765432")
phone2.take_photo()
